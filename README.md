## Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

The problem this application attempts to solve is the lack of a quality marketplace for second hand computer parts. 

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Currently the main mediums for selling second hand computer parts are eBay and facebook marketplace. Facebook marketplace is not very user friendly, with an unintuitive user interface. The listings that are displayed to the user are highly algorithm driven which significantly affects a user's ability to search for desired listings. 

The major advantage of Facebook marketplace is the ability to list items for free, and the ease of communication with another user.

eBay is a better platform for searching for listings based on desired characteristics
